In this project, the PHP script index.php reads the contents of the data.json file using file_get_contents() and then decodes the JSON data into an associative array using json_decode(). The script then iterates over the array and displays the employee data in an HTML table.

To test this project, start a local development server and access the index.php page in your browser. You should see a table displaying the employee data fetched from the JSON file.

You can enhance this project further by adding additional styling, handling larger datasets, or implementing more complex functionality based on your needs.
